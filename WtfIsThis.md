# What is this
So pretty much one team has to protect a president (player) from another team, whose goal is to kill him.

# Teams
* President - The president, once he dies he has to switch team (only one who shows up as blip)

* Vice President - "Replacement" President, can respawn freely, becomes the new president once president dies, only can be choosen once, afterwards blocked until next round

* Bodyguards - Protect the president by any means

* Terrorists - Kill president by any means

* Civilians - Pretty much seperated, can kill anyone (including themselves)

# Area
President, Vice President and Bodyguards spawn together.

Terrorists and Civilians are seperated each.

The game chooses a random game-area each round (preferably not the same as last round). The SAMP gamemode chose between Los Santos, Las Venturas and that other city I can't remember the name of. Could probably divide up in Los Santos and the rest of the map (or just have the whole map as play area always if it plays good).

# Gear
* President spawns with full armor and only melee weapons.

* Vice President spawns with full armor and a simple pistol.
 
* Bodyguards spawn with no armor and a carbine rifle.
 
* Terrorists spawn with an assault rifle.
 
* Civilians spawn with nothing

# Spawn Gear
Bodyguard spawn has more weapons (nothing OP though please), armor, some armored vehicle, a turret limo and some helis (president (and maybe Vice President) should not be able to fly in them).

Terrorists spawn has more weapons (same as above), some simple cars, helis (non-shooting ones) and these machine gun planes.

Civilians have some simple weapons and a big amount of civilian vehicles. Maybe machine gun planes too, idk.

# Gamerules
* 10 min cap sounds good

* Terrorists and Civilians spawn faster than Bodyguards

* idk, ask me if something is unclarified
