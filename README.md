# What is this
So pretty much one team has to protect a president (player) from another team, whose goal is to kill him.

# Teams
* President - The president, once he dies he has to switch team (only one who shows up as blip)

* Vice President - "Replacement" President, can respawn freely, becomes the new president once president dies, only can be choosen once, afterwards blocked until next round

* Bodyguards - Protect the president by any means

* Terrorists - Kill president by any means

* Civilians - Pretty much seperated, can kill anyone (including themselves)

This was originally Created for SAMP, Then Icehax and Scammer both worked together to bring this project to fivem (they later abandoned the project in a semi working state. i have since fixed most of the issues and got quite a few of the bugs out of this. i got alot of flack for wanting to release this but i personally feel its right to do so for the fivem community.
