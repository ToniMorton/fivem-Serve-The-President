# What is this
So pretty much one team has to protect a president (player) from another team, whose goal is to kill him.

# Teams
* President - The president, once he dies he has to switch team (only one who shows up as blip)

* Vice President - "Replacement" President, can respawn freely, becomes the new president once president dies, only can be choosen once, afterwards blocked until next round

* Bodyguards - Protect the president by any means

* Terrorists - Kill president by any means

* Civilians - Pretty much seperated, can kill anyone (including themselves)
